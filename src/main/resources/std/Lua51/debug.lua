debug = {}

---
--- Enters an interactive mode with the user, running each string that the user
--- enters. Using simple commands and other debug facilities, the user can
--- inspect global and local variables, change their values, evaluate
--- expressions, and so on. A line containing only the word `cont` finishes this
--- function, so that the caller continues its execution.
---
--- Note that commands for `debug.debug` are not lexically nested within any
--- function, and so have no direct access to local variables.
function debug.debug() end

--- Returns the environment of object `o`.
function debug.getfenv(o) end

---
--- Returns the current hook settings of the thread, as three values: the
--- current hook function, the current hook mask, and the current hook count
--- (as set by the `debug.sethook` function).
---@overload fun():thread
---@param thread thread
---@return thread

---
--- Returns a table with information about a function. You can give the
--- function directly, or you can give a number as the value of `f`,
--- which means the function running at level `f` of the call stack
--- of the given thread: level 0 is the current function (`getinfo` itself);
--- level 1 is the function that called `getinfo` (except for tail calls, which
--- do not count on the stack); and so on. If `f` is a number larger than
--- the number of active functions, then `getinfo` returns **nil**.
---
--- The returned table can contain all the fields returned by `lua_getinfo`,
--- with the string `what` describing which fields to fill in. The default for
--- `what` is to get all information available, except the table of valid
--- lines. If present, the option '`f`' adds a field named `func` with the
--- function itself. If present, the option '`L`' adds a field named
--- `activelines` with the table of valid lines.
---
--- For instance, the expression `debug.getinfo(1,"n").name` returns a table
--- with a name for the current function, if a reasonable name can be found,
--- and the expression `debug.getinfo(print)` returns a table with all available
--- information about the `print` function.

---
--- This function returns the name and the value of the local variable with
--- index `local` of the function at level `level f` of the stack. This function
--- accesses not only explicit local variables, but also parameters,
--- temporaries, etc.
---
--- The first parameter or local variable has index 1, and so on, following the
--- order that they are declared in the code, counting only the variables that
--- are active in the current scope of the function. Negative indices refer to
--- vararg parameters; -1 is the first vararg parameter. The function returns
--- **nil** if there is no variable with the given index, and raises an error
--- when called with a level out of range. (You can call `debug.getinfo` to
--- check whether the level is valid.)
---
--- Variable names starting with '(' (open parenthesis) represent variables with
--- no known names (internal variables such as loop control variables, and
--- variables from chunks saved without debug information).
---
--- The parameter `f` may also be a function. In that case, `getlocal` returns
--- only the name of function parameters.
---@overload fun(f:table, var:string):table
---@param thread thread
---@param f table
---@param var string
---@return table

--- Returns the metatable of the given `value` or **nil** if it does not have
--- a metatable.
---@param value table
---@return table
function debug.getmetatable(value) end

---
--- Returns the registry table.
---@return table
function debug.getregistry() end

---
--- This function returns the name and the value of the upvalue with index
--- `up` of the function `f`. The function returns **nil** if there is no
--- upvalue with the given index.
---
--- Variable names starting with '(' (open parenthesis) represent variables with
--- no known names (variables from chunks saved without debug information).
---@param f number
---@param up number
---@return table
function debug.getupvalue(f, up) end

--- Sets the environment of the given object to the given table. Returns object.
---@generic T
---@param object T
---@param table table
---@return T
function debug.setfenv(object, table) end

---
--- Sets the given function as a hook. The string `mask` and the number `count`
--- describe when the hook will be called. The string mask may have any
--- combination of the following characters, with the given meaning:
---
--- * `"c"`: the hook is called every time Lua calls a function;
--- * `"r"`: the hook is called every time Lua returns from a function;
--- * `"l"`: the hook is called every time Lua enters a new line of code.
---
--- Moreover, with a `count` different from zero, the hook is called after every
--- `count` instructions.
---
--- When called without arguments, `debug.sethook` turns off the hook.
---
--- When the hook is called, its first parameter is a string describing
--- the event that has triggered its call: `"call"`, (or `"tail
--- call"`), `"return"`, `"line"`, and `"count"`. For line events, the hook also
--- gets the new line number as its second parameter. Inside a hook, you can
--- call `getinfo` with level 2 to get more information about the running
--- function (level 0 is the `getinfo` function, and level 1 is the hook
--- function)

--- This function assigns the value `value` to the local variable with
--- index `local` of the function at level `level` of the stack. The function
--- returns **nil** if there is no local variable with the given index, and
--- raises an error when called with a `level` out of range. (You can call
--- `getinfo` to check whether the level is valid.) Otherwise, it returns the
--- name of the local variable.

--- can be **nil**). Returns value.
---@param value any
---@param table table
---@return boolean
function debug.setmetatable(value, table) end

---
--- This function assigns the value `value` to the upvalue with index `up`
--- of the function `f`. The function returns **nil** if there is no upvalue
--- with the given index. Otherwise, it returns the name of the upvalue.

---@param up number
---@param value any
---@return string
function debug.setupvalue(f, up, value) end

--- If `message` is present but is neither a string nor **nil**, this function
--- returns `message` without further processing. Otherwise, it returns a string
--- with a traceback of the call stack. The optional `message` string is
--- appended at the beginning of the traceback. An optional level number
--- `tells` at which level to start the traceback (default is 1, the function
--- c alling `traceback`).
