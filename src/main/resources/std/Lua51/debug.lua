debug = {}

---
--- Enters an interactive mode with the user, running each string that
--- the user enters. Using simple commands and other debug facilities,
--- the user can inspect global and local variables, change their values,
--- evaluate expressions, and so on. A line containing only the word `cont`
--- finishes this function, so that the caller continues its execution.
--- Note that commands for `debug.debug` are not lexically nested within any
--- function, and so have no direct access to local variables.
function debug.debug() end

---
--- Returns the environment of object `o`.
function debug.getfenv(o) end

---
--- Returns the current hook settings of the thread, as three values: the
--- current hook function, the current hook mask, and the current hook count
--- (as set by the `debug.sethook` function).
function debug.gethook(thread) end

---
--- Returns a table with information about a function. You can give the
--- function directly, or you can give a number as the value of `function`,
--- which means the function running at level `function` of the call stack
--- of the given thread: level 0 is the current function (`getinfo` itself);
--- level 1 is the function that called `getinfo`; and so on. If `function`
--- is a number larger than the number of active functions, then `getinfo`
--- returns nil.
---
--- `thread` and `what` are optional.
---
--- The returned table can contain all the fields returned by `lua_getinfo`,
--- with the string `what` describing which fields to fill in. The default for
--- `what` is to get all information available, except the table of valid
--- lines. If present, the option '`f`' adds a field named `func` with
--- the function itself. If present, the option '`L`' adds a field named
--- `activelines` with the table of valid lines.
--- For instance, the expression `debug.getinfo(1,"n").name` returns a table
--- with a name for the current function, if a reasonable name can be found,
--- and the expression `debug.getinfo(print)` returns a table with all available
--- information about the `print` function.
---@param optional what number
function debug.getinfo(thread, func, what) end

---
--- This function returns the name and the value of the local variable with
--- index `local` of the function at level `level` of the stack. (The first
--- parameter or local variable has index 1, and so on, until the last active
--- local variable.) The function returns nil if there is no local variable
--- with the given index, and raises an error when called with a `level` out
--- of range. (You can call `debug.getinfo` to check whether the level is valid.)
--- Variable names starting with '`(`' (open parentheses) represent internal
--- variables (loop control variables, temporaries, and C function locals).
function debug.getlocal(thread, level, name) end

---
--- Returns the metatable of the given `object` or nil if it does not have
--- a metatable.
function debug.getmetatable(object) end

---
--- Returns the registry table (see ยง3.5).
function debug.getregistry() end

---
--- This function returns the name and the value of the upvalue with index
--- `up` of the function `func`. The function returns nil if there is no
--- upvalue with the given index.
function debug.getupvalue(func, up) end

---
--- Sets the environment of the given `object` to the given `table`. Returns
--- `object`.
function debug.setfenv(object, table) end

---
--- Sets the given function as a hook. The string `mask` and the number
--- `count` describe when the hook will be called. The string mask may have
--- the following characters, with the given meaning:
---
--- * `"c"`: the hook is called every time Lua calls a function;
--- * `"r"`: the hook is called every time Lua returns from a function;
--- * `"l"`: the hook is called every time Lua enters a new line of code.
---
--- With a `count` different from zero, the hook is called after every `count`
--- instructions.
---
--- When called without arguments, `debug.sethook` turns off the hook.
---
--- When the hook is called, its first parameter is a string describing
--- the event that has triggered its call: `"call"`, `"return"` (or `"tail
--- return"`, when simulating a return from a tail call), `"line"`, and
--- `"count"`. For line events, the hook also gets the new line number as its
--- second parameter. Inside a hook, you can call `getinfo` with level 2 to
--- get more information about the running function (level 0 is the `getinfo`
--- function, and level 1 is the hook function), unless the event is `"tail
--- return"`. In this case, Lua is only simulating the return, and a call to
--- `getinfo` will return invalid data.
function debug.sethook(thread, hook, mask, count) end

---
--- This function assigns the value `value` to the local variable with
--- index `local` of the function at level `level` of the stack. The function
--- returns nil if there is no local variable with the given index, and raises
--- an error when called with a `level` out of range. (You can call `getinfo`
--- to check whether the level is valid.) Otherwise, it returns the name of
--- the local variable.
function debug.setlocal(thread, level, name, value) end

---
--- Sets the metatable for the given `object` to the given `table` (which
--- can be nil).
function debug.setmetatable(object, table) end

---
--- This function assigns the value `value` to the upvalue with index `up`
--- of the function `func`. The function returns nil if there is no upvalue
--- with the given index. Otherwise, it returns the name of the upvalue.
function debug.setupvalue(func, up, value) end

--- Sets the given value as the Lua value associated to the given udata. udata must be a full userdata.
--- Returns udata.
function debug.setuservalue(udata, value) end

--- If message is present but is neither a string nor nil, this function
--- returns message without further processing. Otherwise, it returns a string
--- with a traceback of the call stack. The optional message string is appended
--- at the beginning of the traceback. An optional level number tells at which
--- level to start the traceback (default is 1, the function calling traceback).
function debug.traceback(thread, message, level) end

--- Returns a unique identifier (as a light userdata) for the upvalue numbered n from the given function.
--- These unique identifiers allow a program to check whether different
--- closures share upvalues. Lua closures that share an upvalue (that is, that
--- access a same external local variable) will return identical ids for those upvalue indices.
function debug.upvalueid(f, n) end

--- Make the n1-th upvalue of the Lua closure f1 refer to the n2-th upvalue of the Lua closure f2.
function debug.upvaluejoin(f1, n1, f2, n2) end
