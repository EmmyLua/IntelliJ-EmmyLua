io = {}

--- File object
--- @class file
local file = {}

---
--- Closes `file`. Note that files are automatically closed when their
--- handles are garbage collected, but that takes an unpredictable amount of
--- time to happen.
function file:close() end

---
--- Saves any written data to `file`.
function file:flush() end

---
--- Returns an iterator function that, each time it is called, returns a
--- new line from the file. Therefore, the construction
--- for line in file:lines() do *body* end
--- will iterate over all lines of the file. (Unlike `io.lines`, this function
--- does not close the file when the loop ends.)
---@return fun():void
function file:lines() end

---
--- Reads the file `file`, according to the given formats, which specify
--- what to read. For each format, the function returns a string (or a number)
--- with the characters read, or nil if it cannot read data with the specified
--- format. When called without formats, it uses a default format that reads
--- the entire next line (see below).
--- The available formats are
--- "*n": reads a number; this is the only format that returns a number
--- instead of a string.
--- "*a": reads the whole file, starting at the current position. On end of
--- file, it returns the empty string.
--- "*l": reads the next line (skipping the end of line), returning nil on
--- end of file. This is the default format.
--- *number*: reads a string with up to this number of characters, returning
--- nil on end of file. If number is zero, it reads nothing and returns an
--- empty string, or nil on end of file.
function file:read(...) end

---
--- Sets and gets the file position, measured from the beginning of the
--- file, to the position given by `offset` plus a base specified by the string
--- `whence`, as follows:
--- "set": base is position 0 (beginning of the file);
--- "cur": base is current position;
--- "end": base is end of file;
--- In case of success, function `seek` returns the final file position,
--- measured in bytes from the beginning of the file. If this function fails,
--- it returns nil, plus a string describing the error.
--- The default value for `whence` is `"cur"`, and for `offset` is 0. Therefore,
--- the call `file:seek()` returns the current file position, without changing
--- it; the call `file:seek("set")` sets the position to the beginning of the
--- file (and returns 0); and the call `file:seek("end")` sets the position
--- to the end of the file, and returns its size.
---@param whence string
---@param offset number
function file:seek(whence, offset) end

---
--- Sets the buffering mode for an output file. There are three available
--- modes:
---
--- * "no": no buffering; the result of any output operation appears immediately.
--- * "full": full buffering; output operation is performed only when the
--- buffer is full (or when you explicitly `flush` the file (see `io.flush`)).
--- * "line": line buffering; output is buffered until a newline is output or
--- there is any input from some special files (such as a terminal device).
--- For the last two cases, `size` specifies the size of the buffer, in
--- bytes. The default is an appropriate size.
---@param mode string
---@param size number
function file:setvbuf(mode, size) end

---
--- Writes the value of each of its arguments to the `file`. The arguments
--- must be strings or numbers. To write other values, use `tostring` or
--- `string.format` before `write`.
function file:write(...) end


---
--- Equivalent to `file:close()`. Without a `file`, closes the default
--- output file.
---@param file file
function io.close(file) end

---
--- Equivalent to `file:flush` over the default output file.
function io.flush() end

---
--- When called with a file name, it opens the named file (in text mode),
--- and sets its handle as the default input file. When called with a file
--- handle, it simply sets this file handle as the default input file. When
--- called without parameters, it returns the current default input file.
--- In case of errors this function raises the error, instead of returning an
--- error code.
---@overload fun():number
---@param file string|file
---@return number
function io.input(file) end

---
--- Opens the given file name in read mode and returns an iterator function
--- that, each time it is called, returns a new line from the file. Therefore,
--- the construction
--- for line in io.lines(filename) do *body* end
--- will iterate over all lines of the file. When the iterator function detects
--- the end of file, it returns nil (to finish the loop) and automatically
--- closes the file.
--- The call `io.lines()` (with no file name) is equivalent to
--- `io.input():lines()`; that is, it iterates over the lines of the default
--- input file. In this case it does not close the file when the loop ends.
function io.lines(filename) end

---
--- This function opens a file, in the mode specified in the string `mode`. It
--- returns a new file handle, or, in case of errors, nil plus an error message.
--- The `mode` string can be any of the following:
--- "r": read mode (the default);
--- "w": write mode;
--- "a": append mode;
--- "r+": update mode, all previous data is preserved;
--- "w+": update mode, all previous data is erased;
--- "a+": append update mode, previous data is preserved, writing is only
--- allowed at the end of file.
--- The `mode` string can also have a '`b`' at the end, which is needed in
--- some systems to open the file in binary mode. This string is exactly what
--- is used in the standard C function `fopen`.
---@return file
function io.open(filename, mode) return file end

---
--- Similar to `io.input`, but operates over the default output file.
function io.output(file) end

---
--- Starts program `prog` in a separated process and returns a file handle
--- that you can use to read data from this program (if `mode` is `"r"`,
--- the default) or to write data to this program (if `mode` is `"w"`).
--- This function is system dependent and is not available on all platforms.
function io.popen(prog, mode) end

---
--- Equivalent to `io.input():read`.
function io.read(...) end

--- * `io.stderr`: Standard error.
stderr = file

--- * `io.stdin`: Standard in.
stdin = file

--- * `io.stdout`: Standard out.
stdout = file


---
--- Returns a handle for a temporary file. This file is opened in update
--- mode and it is automatically removed when the program ends.
function io.tmpfile() end

---
--- Checks whether `obj` is a valid file handle. Returns the string `"file"`
--- if `obj` is an open file handle, `"closed file"` if `obj` is a closed file
--- handle, or nil if `obj` is not a file handle.
function io.type(obj) end

---
--- Equivalent to `io.output():write`.
function io.write(...) end
