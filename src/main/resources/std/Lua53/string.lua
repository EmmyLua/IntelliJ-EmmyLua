---@class string
string = {}

---
--- Returns the internal numerical codes of the characters `s[i]`, `s[i+1]`,
--- ..., `s[j]`. The default value for `i` is 1; the default value for `j`
--- is `i`.
--- Note that numerical codes are not necessarily portable across platforms.
---@param s string
---@param optional i number
---@param optional j number
function string.byte(s, i, j) end

---
--- Receives zero or more integers. Returns a string with length equal to
--- the number of arguments, in which each character has the internal numerical
--- code equal to its corresponding argument.
--- Note that numerical codes are not necessarily portable across platforms.
---@return string
function string.char(...) end

---
--- Returns a string containing a binary representation of the given
--- function, so that a later `loadstring` on this string returns a copy of
--- the function. `function` must be a Lua function without upvalues.
---@param func fun()
function string.dump(func) end

---
--- Looks for the first match of `pattern` in the string `s`. If it finds a
--- match, then `find` returns the indices of `s` where this occurrence starts
--- and ends; otherwise, it returns nil. A third, optional numerical argument
--- `init` specifies where to start the search; its default value is 1 and
--- can be negative. A value of true as a fourth, optional argument `plain`
--- turns off the pattern matching facilities, so the function does a plain
--- "find substring" operation, with no characters in `pattern` being considered
--- "magic". Note that if `plain` is given, then `init` must be given as well.
--- If the pattern has captures, then in a successful match the captured values
--- are also returned, after the two indices.
---@overload fun(s:string, pattern:string):number, number
---@overload fun(s:string, pattern:string, init:number):number, number
---@param s string
---@param pattern string
---@param init number
---@param plain boolean
---@return number, number
function string.find(s, pattern, init, plain) end

---
--- Returns a formatted version of its variable number of arguments following
--- the description given in its first argument (which must be a string). The
--- format string follows the same rules as the `printf` family of standard C
--- functions. The only differences are that the options/modifiers `*`, `l`,
--- `L`, `n`, `p`, and `h` are not supported and that there is an extra option,
--- `q`. The `q` option formats a string in a form suitable to be safely read
--- back by the Lua interpreter: the string is written between double quotes,
--- and all double quotes, newlines, embedded zeros, and backslashes in the
--- string are correctly escaped when written. For instance, the call
---
--- string.format('%q', 'a string with "quotes" and \n new line')
---
--- will produce the string:
---
--- "a string with \"quotes\" and \
--- new line"
---
--- The options `c`, `d`, `E`, `e`, `f`, `g`, `G`, `i`, `o`, `u`, `X`, and
--- `x` all expect a number as argument, whereas `q` and `s` expect a string.
--- This function does not accept string values containing embedded zeros,
--- except as arguments to the `q` option.
---@param formatstring string
---@return string
function string.format(formatstring, ...) end

---
--- Returns an iterator function that, each time it is called, returns the
--- next captures from `pattern` over string `s`. If `pattern` specifies no
--- captures, then the whole match is produced in each call.
--- As an example, the following loop
---
--- s = "hello world from Lua"
--- for w in string.gmatch(s, "%a+") do
--- print(w)
--- end
---
--- will iterate over all the words from string `s`, printing one per line. The
--- next example collects all pairs `key=value` from the given string into
--- a table:
---
--- t = {}
--- s = "from=world, to=Lua"
--- for k, v in string.gmatch(s, "(%w+)=(%w+)") do
--- t[k] = v
--- end
---
--- For this function, a '`^`' at the start of a pattern does not work as an
--- anchor, as this would prevent the iteration.
---@param s string
---@param pattern string
function string.gmatch(s, pattern) end

---
--- Returns a copy of `s` in which all (or the first `n`, if given)
--- occurrences of the `pattern` have been replaced by a replacement string
--- specified by `repl`, which can be a string, a table, or a function. `gsub`
--- also returns, as its second value, the total number of matches that occurred.
---
--- If `repl` is a string, then its value is used for replacement. The character
--- `%` works as an escape character: any sequence in `repl` of the form `%n`,
--- with *n* between 1 and 9, stands for the value of the *n*-th captured
--- substring (see below). The sequence `%0` stands for the whole match. The
--- sequence `%%` stands for a single `%`.
---
--- If `repl` is a table, then the table is queried for every match, using
--- the first capture as the key; if the pattern specifies no captures, then
--- the whole match is used as the key.
---
--- If `repl` is a function, then this function is called every time a match
--- occurs, with all captured substrings passed as arguments, in order; if
--- the pattern specifies no captures, then the whole match is passed as a
--- sole argument.
---
--- If the value returned by the table query or by the function call is a
--- string or a number, then it is used as the replacement string; otherwise,
--- if it is false or nil, then there is no replacement (that is, the original
--- match is kept in the string).
---
--- Here are some examples:
--- x = string.gsub("hello world", "(%w+)", "%1 %1")
--- -- > x="hello hello world world"
--- x = string.gsub("hello world", "%w+", "%0 %0", 1)
--- -- > x="hello hello world"
--- x = string.gsub("hello world from Lua", "(%w+)%s*(%w+)", "%2 %1")
--- -- > x="world hello Lua from"
--- x = string.gsub("home = $HOME, user = $USER", "%$(%w+)", os.getenv)
--- -- > x="home = /home/roberto, user = roberto"
--- x = string.gsub("4+5 = $return 4+5$", "%$(.-)%$", function (s)
--- return loadstring(s)()
--- end)
--- -- > x="4+5 = 9"
--- local t = {name="lua", version="5.1"}
--- x = string.gsub("$name-$version.tar.gz", "%$(%w+)", t)
--- -- > x="lua-5.1.tar.gz"
---@overload fun(s:string, pattern:string, repl:table|fun()):void
---@param s string
---@param pattern string
---@param repl table|fun()
---@param n number
function string.gsub(s, pattern, repl, n) end

---
--- Receives a string and returns its length. The empty string `""` has
--- length 0. Embedded zeros are counted, so `"a\000bc\000"` has length 5.
---@param s string
---@return number
function string.len(s) end

---
--- Receives a string and returns a copy of this string with all uppercase
--- letters changed to lowercase. All other characters are left unchanged. The
--- definition of what an uppercase letter is depends on the current locale.
---@param s string
---@return string
function string.lower(s) end

---
--- Looks for the first *match* of `pattern` in the string `s`. If it
--- finds one, then `match` returns the captures from the pattern; otherwise
--- it returns nil. If `pattern` specifies no captures, then the whole match
--- is returned. A third, optional numerical argument `init` specifies where
--- to start the search; its default value is 1 and can be negative.
---@overload fun(s:string, pattern:string):void
---@param s string
---@param pattern string
---@param init number
function string.match(s, pattern, init) end

---
--- Returns a string that is the concatenation of `n` copies of the string
--- `s`.
---@param s string
---@param n number
---@return string
function string.rep(s, n) end

---
--- Returns a string that is the string `s` reversed.
---@param s string
---@return string
function string.reverse(s) end

---
--- Returns the substring of `s` that starts at `i` and continues until
--- `j`; `i` and `j` can be negative. If `j` is absent, then it is assumed to
--- be equal to -1 (which is the same as the string length). In particular,
--- the call `string.sub(s,1,j)` returns a prefix of `s` with length `j`, and
--- `string.sub(s, -i)` returns a suffix of `s` with length `i`.
---@param s string
---@param i number
---@param j number
---@return string
function string.sub(s, i, j) end

---
--- Receives a string and returns a copy of this string with all lowercase
--- letters changed to uppercase. All other characters are left unchanged. The
--- definition of what a lowercase letter is depends on the current locale.
---@param s string
---@return string
function string.upper(s) return "" end
