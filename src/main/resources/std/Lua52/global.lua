--- Issues an error when the value of its argument `v` is false (i.e.,
--- nil or false); otherwise, returns all its arguments. `message` is an error
--- message; when absent, it defaults to "assertion failed!"

function assert(v, message) end

---
--- This function is a generic interface to the garbage collector. It
--- performs different functions according to its first argument, `opt`:
---
--- * "stop": stops the garbage collector.
--- * "restart": restarts the garbage collector.
--- * "collect": performs a full garbage-collection cycle.
--- * "count": returns the total memory in use by Lua (in Kbytes).
--- * "step": performs a garbage-collection step. The step "size" is controlled
--- by `arg` (larger values mean more steps) in a non-specified way. If you
--- want to control the step size you must experimentally tune the value of
--- * "arg". Returns true if the step finished a collection cycle.
--- * "setpause": sets `arg` as the new value for the *pause* of the collector
--- (see §2.10). Returns the previous value for *pause*.
--- * "setstepmul": sets `arg` as the new value for the *step multiplier*
--- of the collector (see §2.10). Returns the previous value for *step*.
---
---@param opt string
---@param arg string
function collectgarbage(opt, arg) end

---
--- Opens the named file and executes its contents as a Lua chunk. When
--- called without arguments,
--- `dofile` executes the contents of the standard input (`stdin`). Returns
--- all values returned by the chunk. In case of errors, `dofile` propagates
--- the error to its caller (that is, `dofile` does not run in protected mode).
---@param filename string
function dofile(filename) end

---
--- Terminates the last protected function called and returns `message`
--- as the error message. Function `error` never returns.
--- Usually, `error` adds some information about the error position at the
--- beginning of the message. The `level` argument specifies how to get the
--- error position. With level 1 (the default), the error position is where the
--- `error` function was called. Level 2 points the error to where the function
--- that called `error` was called; and so on. Passing a level 0 avoids the
--- addition of error position information to the message.
---@overload fun(message:string):void
---@param message string
---@param level number
function error(message, level) end

---
--- A global variable (not a function) that holds the global environment
--- (that is, `_G._G = _G`). Lua itself does not use this variable; changing
--- its value does not affect any environment, nor vice-versa. (Use `setfenv`
--- to change environments.)
--- function _G end
--- * `_G._G`: _G._G
---
--- Returns the current environment in use by the function.
--- `f` can be a Lua function or a number that specifies the function at that
--- stack level: Level 1 is the function calling `getfenv`. If the given
--- function is not a Lua function, or if `f` is 0, `getfenv` returns the
--- global environment. The default for `f` is 1.
---@overload fun():table
---@param f number
---@return table
function getfenv(f) end

---
--- If `object` does not have a metatable, returns nil. Otherwise, if the
--- object's metatable has a `"__metatable"` field, returns the associated
--- value. Otherwise, returns the metatable of the given object.
---@param object any
function getmetatable(object) end

---
--- Returns three values: an iterator function, the table `t`, and 0,
--- so that the construction
--- for i,v in ipairs(t) do *body* end
--- will iterate over the pairs (`1,t[1]`), (`2,t[2]`), ..., up to the
--- first integer key absent from the table.
---@param t table
function ipairs(t) end

---
--- Loads a chunk using function `func` to get its pieces. Each call to
--- `func` must return a string that concatenates with previous results. A
--- return of an empty string, nil, or no value signals the end of the chunk.
--- If there are no errors, returns the compiled chunk as a function; otherwise,
--- returns nil plus the error message. The environment of the returned function
--- is the global environment.
--- `chunkname` is used as the chunk name for error messages and debug
--- information. When absent, it defaults to "`=(load)`".
---@overload fun(func:fun():string):void
---@param func fun():string
---@param chunkname string
function load(func, chunkname) end

---
--- Similar to `load`, but gets the chunk from file `filename` or from the
--- standard input, if no file name is given.
---@param filename string
function loadfile(filename) end

---
--- Similar to `load`, but gets the chunk from the given string.
--- To load and run a given string, use the idiom
--- assert(loadstring(s))()
--- When absent, `chunkname` defaults to the given string.
---@overload fun(string:string):void
---@param string string
---@param chunkname string
function loadstring(string, chunkname) end

---
--- Allows a program to traverse all fields of a table. Its first argument is
--- a table and its second argument is an index in this table. `next` returns
--- the next index of the table and its associated value.
---
--- When called with nil
--- as its second argument, `next` returns an initial index and its associated
--- value. When called with the last index, or with nil in an empty table, `next`
--- returns nil.
---
--- If the second argument is absent, then it is interpreted as
--- nil. In particular, you can use `next(t)` to check whether a table is empty.
--- The order in which the indices are enumerated is not specified, *even for
--- numeric indices*. (To traverse a table in numeric order, use a numerical
--- for or the `ipairs` function.)
---
--- The behavior of `next` is *undefined* if, during the traversal, you assign
--- any value to a non-existent field in the table. You may however modify
--- existing fields. In particular, you may clear existing fields.
---@param table table
---@param index number
function next(table, index) end

---
--- Returns three values: the `next` function, the table `t`, and nil,
--- so that the construction
--- for k,v in pairs(t) do *body* end
--- will iterate over all key–value pairs of table `t`.
--- See function `next` for the caveats of modifying the table during its
--- traversal.
---@param t table
function pairs(t) end

---
--- Calls function `f` with the given arguments in *protected mode*. This
--- means that any error inside `f` is not propagated; instead, `pcall` catches
--- the error and returns a status code. Its first result is the status code (a
--- boolean), which is true if the call succeeds without errors. In such case,
--- `pcall` also returns all results from the call, after this first result. In
--- case of any error, `pcall` returns false plus the error message.
---@param f fun()
function pcall(f, arg1, ...) end

---
--- Receives any number of arguments, and prints their values to `stdout`,
--- using the `tostring` function to convert them to strings. `print` is not
--- intended for formatted output, but only as a quick way to show a value,
--- typically for debugging. For formatted output, use `string.format`.
function print(...) end

---
--- Checks whether `v1` is equal to `v2`, without invoking any
--- metamethod. Returns a boolean.
---@param v1 any
---@param v2 any
function rawequal(v1, v2) end

---
--- Gets the real value of `table[index]`, without invoking any
--- metamethod. `table` must be a table; `index` may be any value.
---@param table table
---@param index any
---@return any
function rawget(table, index) end

---
--- Sets the real value of `table[index]` to `value`, without invoking any
--- metamethod. `table` must be a table, `index` any value different from nil,
--- and `value` any Lua value.
--- This function returns `table`.
---@param table table
---@param index any
---@param value any
function rawset(table, index, value) end

---
--- If `index` is a number, returns all arguments after argument number
--- `index`. Otherwise, `index` must be the string `"#"`, and `select` returns
--- the total number of extra arguments it received.
---@param index number|string
function select(index, ...) end

---
--- Sets the environment to be used by the given function. `f` can be a Lua
--- function or a number that specifies the function at that stack level: Level
--- 1 is the function calling `setfenv`. `setfenv` returns the given function.
--- As a special case, when `f` is 0 `setfenv` changes the environment of the
--- running thread. In this case, `setfenv` returns no values.
---@param f number
---@param table table
function setfenv(f, table) end

---
--- Sets the metatable for the given table. (You cannot change the metatable
--- of other types from Lua, only from C.) If `metatable` is nil, removes the
--- metatable of the given table. If the original metatable has a `"__metatable"`
--- field, raises an error.
--- This function returns `table`.
---@param table table
---@param metatable table
function setmetatable(table, metatable) end

---
--- Tries to convert its argument to a number. If the argument is already
--- a number or a string convertible to a number, then `tonumber` returns this
--- number; otherwise, it returns nil.
--- An optional argument specifies the base to interpret the numeral. The base
--- may be any integer between 2 and 36, inclusive. In bases above 10, the
--- letter '`A`' (in either upper or lower case) represents 10, '`B`' represents
--- 11, and so forth, with '`Z`' representing 35. In base 10 (the default),
--- the number can have a decimal part, as well as an optional exponent part
--- (see §2.1). In other bases, only unsigned integers are accepted.
---@overload fun(e:any):number
---@param e any
---@param base number
function tonumber(e, base) end

---
--- Receives an argument of any type and converts it to a string in a
--- reasonable format. For complete control of how numbers are converted, use
--- `string.format`.
--- If the metatable of `e` has a `"__tostring"` field, then `tostring` calls
--- the corresponding value with `e` as argument, and uses the result of the
--- call as its result.
---@param e any
function tostring(e) end

---
--- Returns the type of its only argument, coded as a string. The possible
--- results of this function are "
--- `nil`" (a string, not the value nil), "`number`", "`string`", "`boolean`",
--- "`table`", "`function`", "`thread`", and "`userdata`".
---@param v any
function type(v) end

---
--- Returns the elements from the given table. This function is equivalent to
--- return list[i], list[i+1], ..., list[j]
--- except that the above code can be written only for a fixed number of
--- elements. By default, `i` is 1 and `j` is the length of the list, as
--- defined by the length operator (see §2.5.5).
---@overload fun(list:table):void
---@param list table
---@param i number

---
--- A global variable (not a function) that holds a string containing the
--- current interpreter version. The current contents of this variable is
--- "`Lua 5.1`".
--- function _VERSION end
--- * `_G._VERSION`: _G._VERSION

---
--- This function is similar to `pcall`, except that you can set a new
--- error handler.
--- `xpcall` calls function `f` in protected mode, using `err` as the error
--- handler. Any error inside `f` is not propagated; instead, `xpcall` catches
--- the error, calls the `err` function with the original error object, and
--- returns a status code. Its first result is the status code (a boolean),
--- which is true if the call succeeds without errors. In this case, `xpcall`
--- also returns all results from the call, after this first result. In case
--- of any error, `xpcall` returns false plus the result from `err`.
function xpcall(f, err) end

---
--- Creates a module. If there is a table in `package.loaded[name]`,
--- this table is the module. Otherwise, if there is a global table `t`
--- with the given name, this table is the module. Otherwise creates a new
--- table `t` and sets it as the value of the global `name` and the value of
--- `package.loaded[name]`. This function also initializes `t._NAME` with the
--- given name, `t._M` with the module (`t` itself), and `t._PACKAGE` with the
--- package name (the full module name minus last component; see below). Finally,
--- `module` sets `t` as the new environment of the current function and the
--- new value of `package.loaded[name]`, so that `require` returns `t`.
--- If `name` is a compound name (that is, one with components separated by
--- dots), `module` creates (or reuses, if they already exist) tables for each
--- component. For instance, if `name` is `a.b.c`, then `module` stores the
--- module table in field `c` of field `b` of global `a`.
--- This function can receive optional *options* after the module name, where
--- each option is a function to be applied over the module.
---@param name string
function module(name, ...) end

---
--- Loads the given module. The function starts by looking into the
--- `package.loaded` table to determine whether `modname` is already
--- loaded. If it is, then `require` returns the value stored at
--- `package.loaded[modname]`. Otherwise, it tries to find a *loader* for
--- the module.
--- To find a loader, `require` is guided by the `package.loaders` array. By
--- changing this array, we can change how `require` looks for a module. The
--- following explanation is based on the default configuration for
--- `package.loaders`.
--- First `require` queries `package.preload[modname]`. If it has a value,
--- this value (which should be a function) is the loader. Otherwise `require`
--- searches for a Lua loader using the path stored in `package.path`. If
--- that also fails, it searches for a C loader using the path stored in
--- `package.cpath`. If that also fails, it tries an *all-in-one* loader (see
--- `package.loaders`).
--- Once a loader is found, `require` calls the loader with a single argument,
--- `modname`. If the loader returns any value, `require` assigns the returned
--- value to `package.loaded[modname]`. If the loader returns no value and
--- has not assigned any value to `package.loaded[modname]`, then `require`
--- assigns true to this entry. In any case, `require` returns the final value
--- of `package.loaded[modname]`.
--- If there is any error loading or running the module, or if it cannot find
--- any loader for the module, then `require` signals an error.
---@param modname string
---@return any
function require(modname) end
