coroutine = {}

---
--- Creates a new coroutine, with body `f`. `f` must be a Lua function. Returns
--- this new coroutine, an object with type `"thread"`.
---@param f fun():thread
---@return thread
function coroutine.create(f) end

---
--- Starts or continues the execution of coroutine `co`. The first time you
--- resume a coroutine, it starts running its body. The values `val1`, ...
--- are passed as the arguments to the body function. If the coroutine has
--- yielded, `resume` restarts it; the values `val1`, ... are passed as the
--- results from the yield.
---
--- If the coroutine runs without any errors, `resume` returns **true** plus any
--- values passed to `yield` (when the coroutine yields) or any values returned
--- by the body function (when the coroutine terminates). If there is any error,
--- `resume` returns **false** plus the error message.
---@overload fun(co:thread):boolean|any
---@param co thread
---@param val1 string
---@return thread|any
function coroutine.resume(co, val1, ...) end

---
--- Returns the status of coroutine `co`, as a string: "`running`", if the
--- coroutine is running (that is, it called `status`); "`suspended`", if the
--- coroutine is suspended in a call to `yield`, or if it has not started
--- running yet; "`normal`" if the coroutine is active but not running (that
--- is, it has resumed another coroutine); and "`dead`" if the coroutine has
--- finished its body function, or if it has stopped with an error.
---@param co thread
---@return string
function coroutine.status(co) end

---
--- Creates a new coroutine, with body `f`. `f` must be a Lua function. Returns
--- a function that resumes the coroutine each time it is called. Any arguments
--- passed to the function behave as the extra arguments to `resume`. Returns
--- the same values returned by `resume`, except the first
--- boolean. In case of error, propagates the error.
---@param f fun():thread
---@return fun():any
function coroutine.wrap(f) end

---
--- Suspends the execution of the calling coroutine. Any arguments to `yield`
--- are passed as extra results to `resume`.
---@return any
function coroutine.yield(...) end
