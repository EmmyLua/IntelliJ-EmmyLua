--- Calls error if the value of its argument `v` is false (i.e., **nil** or
--- **false**); otherwise, returns all its arguments. In case of error,
--- `message` is the error object; when absent, it defaults to "assertion
--- failed!"

---
--- This function is a generic interface to the garbage collector. It performs
--- different functions according to its first argument, `opt`:
---
--- **"collect"**: performs a full garbage-collection cycle. This is the default
--- option.
--- **"stop"**: stops automatic execution of the garbage collector. The
--- collector will run only when explicitly invoked, until a call to restart it.
--- **"restart"**: restarts automatic execution of the garbage collector.
--- **"count"**: returns the total memory in use by Lua in Kbytes. The value has
--- a fractional part, so that it multiplied by 1024 gives the exact number of
--- bytes in use by Lua (except for overflows).
--- **"step"**: performs a garbage-collection step. The step "size" is
--- controlled by `arg`. With a zero value, the collector will perform one basic
--- (indivisible) step. For non-zero values, the collector will perform as if
--- that amount of memory (in KBytes) had been allocated by Lua. Returns
--- **true** if the step finished a collection cycle.
--- **"setpause"**: sets `arg` as the new value for the *pause* of the collector
--- (see §2.5). Returns the previous value for *pause`.
--- **"incremental"**: Change the collector mode to incremental. This option can
--- be followed by three numbers: the garbage-collector pause, the step
--- multiplier, and the step size.
--- **"generational"**: Change the collector mode to generational. This option
--- can be followed by two numbers: the garbage-collector minor multiplier and
--- the major multiplier.
--- **"isrunning"**: returns a boolean that tells whether the collector is
--- running (i.e., not stopped).
---@overload fun():any
---@param opt string
---@param arg string
---@return any
function collectgarbage(opt, arg) end

---
--- Opens the named file and executes its contents as a Lua chunk. When called
--- without arguments, `dofile` executes the contents of the standard input
--- (`stdin`). Returns all values returned by the chunk. In case of errors,
--- `dofile` propagates the error to its caller (that is, `dofile` does not run
--- in protected mode).
---@overload fun():table
---@param filename string
---@return table
function dofile(filename) end

---
--- Terminates the last protected function called and returns `message` as the
--- error object. Function `error` never returns. Usually, `error` adds some
--- information about the error position at the beginning of the message, if the
--- message is a string. The `level` argument specifies how to get the error
--- position. With level 1 (the default), the error position is where the
--- `error` function was called. Level 2 points the error to where the function
--- that called `error` was called; and so on. Passing a level 0 avoids the
--- addition of error position information to the message.
---@overload fun(message:string)
---@param message string

---
--- A global variable (not a function) that holds the global environment. Lua
--- itself does not use this variable; changing its value does not affect any
--- environment, nor vice versa.
---@class _G
_G = {}

---
--- If `object` does not have a metatable, returns **nil**. Otherwise, if the
--- object's metatable has a `"__metatable"` field, returns the associated
--- value. Otherwise, returns the metatable of the given object.
---@param object any
---@return any
function getmetatable(object) end

---
--- Returns three values (an iterator function, the table `t`, and 0) so that
--- the construction
--- > `for i,v in ipairs(t) do` *body* `end`
--- will iterate over the key–value pairs (1,`t[1]`), (2,`t[2]`), ..., up to
--- the first absent index.

---
--- Loads a chunk.
--- If `chunk` is a string, the chunk is this string. If `chunk` is a function,
--- `load` calls it repeatedly to get the chunk pieces. Each call to `chunk`
--- must return a string that concatenates with previous results. A return of
--- an empty string, **nil**, or no value signals the end of the chunk.
---
--- If there are no syntactic errors, returns the compiled chunk as a function;
--- otherwise, returns **nil** plus the error message.
---
--- If the resulting function has upvalues, the first upvalue is set to the
--- value of `env`, if that parameter is given, or to the value of the global
--- environment. Other upvalues are initialized with **nil**. (When you load a
--- main chunk, the resulting function will always have exactly one upvalue, the
--- _ENV variable. However, when you load a binary chunk created from a
--- function (see string.dump), the resulting function can have an arbitrary
--- number of upvalues.) All upvalues are fresh, that is, they are not shared
--- with any other function.
---
--- `chunkname` is used as the name of the chunk for error messages and debug
--- information. When absent, it defaults to `chunk`, if `chunk` is a string,
--- or to "=(`load`)" otherwise.
---
--- The string `mode` controls whether the chunk can be text or binary (that is,
--- a precompiled chunk). It may be the string "b" (only binary chunks), "t"
--- (only text chunks), or "bt" (both binary and text). The default is "bt".
---
--- Lua does not check the consistency of binary chunks. Maliciously crafted
--- binary chunks can crash the interpreter.

---
--- Allows a program to traverse all fields of a table. Its first argument is
--- a table and its second argument is an index in this table. `next` returns
--- the next index of the table and its associated value. When called with
--- **nil** as its second argument, `next` returns an initial index and its
--- associated value. When called with the last index, or with **nil** in an
--- empty table, `next` returns **nil**. If the second argument is absent, then
--- it is interpreted as **nil**. In particular, you can use `next(t)` to check
--- whether a table is empty.
---
--- The order in which the indices are enumerated is not specified, *even for
--- numeric indices*. (To traverse a table in numerical order, use a numerical
--- **for**.)
---
--- The behavior of `next` is undefined if, during the traversal, you assign
--- any value to a non-existent field in the table. You may however modify
--- existing fields. In particular, you may set existing fields to nil.

---
--- If `t` has a metamethod `__pairs`, calls it with `t` as argument and returns
--- the first three results from the call.
---
--- Otherwise, returns three values: the `next` function, the table `t`, and
--- **nil**, so that the construction
--- `for k,v in pairs(t) do *body* end`
--- will iterate over all key–value pairs of table `t`.
---
--- See function `next` for the caveats of modifying the table during its

---
--- Calls function `f` with the given arguments in *protected mode*. This
--- means that any error inside `f` is not propagated; instead, `pcall` catches
--- the error and returns a status code. Its first result is the status code (a
--- boolean), which is true if the call succeeds without errors. In such case,
--- `pcall` also returns all results from the call, after this first result. In
--- case of any error, `pcall` returns **false** plus the error message.

--- different from **nil** and NaN, and `value` any Lua value.
---@param table table
---@param index any
---@param value any
function rawset(table, index, value) end

---
--- If `index` is a number, returns all arguments after argument number
--- `index`. a negative number indexes from the end (-1 is the last argument).
--- Otherwise, `index` must be the string "#", and `select` returns
--- the total number of extra arguments it received.

---
--- Sets the metatable for the given table. (To change the metatable of other
--- types from Lua code, you must use the debug library.) If `metatable`
--- is **nil**, removes the metatable of the given table. If the original
--- metatable has a `"__metatable"` field, raises an error.

---
--- When called with no `base`, `tonumber` tries to convert its argument to a
--- number. If the argument is already a number or a string convertible to a
--- number, then `tonumber` returns this number; otherwise, it returns **nil**.
---
--- The conversion of strings can result in integers or floats, according to the
--- lexical conventions of Lua. (The string may have leading and trailing
--- spaces and a sign.)
---
--- When called with `base`, then e must be a string to be interpreted as an
--- integer numeral in that base. The base may be any integer between 2 and 36,
--- inclusive. In bases above 10, the letter 'A' (in either upper or lower case)
--- represents 10, 'B' represents 11, and so forth, with 'Z' representing 35. If
--- the string `e` is not a valid numeral in the given base, the function
--- returns **nil**.

---
--- Receives a value of any type and converts it to a string in a human-readable
--- format. (For complete control of how numbers are converted, use `string
--- .format`).
---
--- If the metatable of `v` has a `__tostring` field, then `tostring` calls
--- the corresponding value with `v` as argument, and uses the result of the
--- call as its result.
---@param v any
